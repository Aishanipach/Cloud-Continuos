# Cloud-Continuous
For this study the workflow is defined as a series of microservices which are executed together (in series/parallel) to achieve a specific task execution. The tasks may also exchange the data and cooperate with each other. 

- Create a Microservice in Flask or Fast API
- Push source code to Github
- Configure Build System to Deploy changes
- Use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to deploy code
